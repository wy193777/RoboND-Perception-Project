# Project: Perception Pick & Place

## Pipeline

### 1. Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting

Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented inside the `segmentation` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 58.

### 2. Clustering for segmentation implemented

Segmentation part is implemented inside the `segmentation` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 88.

Clustering is implemented insdie the `clustering` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 103.

### 3. Features extracted and SVM trained,  object recognition implemented

This part is implemented inside the `classify` function

### 4. Result

See `output_1.yaml`, `output_2.yaml` and `output_3.yaml` inside `./pr2_robot/scripts` folder.
