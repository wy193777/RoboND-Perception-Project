# Project: Perception Pick & Place

## Pipeline

### 1. Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting

Filtering and RANSAC plane fitting implemented inside the `segmentation` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 58.

### 2. Clustering for segmentation implemented

Segmentation part is implemented inside the `segmentation` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 88.

Clustering is implemented insdie the `clustering` function in `project_template.py`, start from line 103.

### 3. Features extracted and SVM trained,  object recognition implemented

This part is implemented inside the `classify` function

### 4. Result

See `output_1.yaml`, `output_2.yaml` and `output_3.yaml` inside `./pr2_robot/scripts` folder.

Spend some time at the end to discuss your code, what techniques you used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how you might improve it if you were going to pursue this project further.
